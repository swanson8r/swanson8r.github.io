# Github Pages

## Overview

The [/docs](./docs) directory of this repository contains an [index.md](docs/index.md) file that is rendered as HTML when deployed to [swanson8r.github.io](https://swanson8r.github.io) via the default [Github Pages publishing workflow triggered on merge to the default branch (`main`).
- See https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart for more details.

Additional deployments from separate repos are managed by Actions under [GitSubmodulePages](https://github.com/swanson8r/gitSubmodulePages), linked to in the **Github Page** column of [./docs/index.md](docs/index.md).
